## How to contribute

ecRxiv is now receiving submissions. 

Go to the [ecRxiv GitHub repo](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecRxiv) for more instructions and author guidelines. 
Our goal is to make is easy for you to submit technical documentation and ecological justification for your ecosystem condition indicator(s) and have it published on the online web application in a standardised format along side other indicators from anywhere in the world.

As a minimum requirement, the documentation must be renderable as an html, and you must submit a separate metadata file (excel template is provided). However, we encourage, and facilitate, the publication of fully reproducible workflows in the form of quarto files and associated data files.
