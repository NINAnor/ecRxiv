# delete the line with the second indicatorID (line 5) 
# if it's not relevant for you.
# In the parentheses you can add a word to distinguish multiple indicators 
# from each other, for example the ecosystem type that they cover
indicatorID: 
  - INDICATORID
  - INDICATORID2 # delete whole line if not needed
# If you are presenting multiple indicators, and have multiple 
# indicator IDs, then add them as a list here, and make sure you add
# the same number of list entries, 
# and in the same order that corresponds to the indicator IDs,  
# to the meta data fields where the indicators differ. 
# For example, if the indicators cover different ecosystem types, 
# add the ecosystems as a list under 'Ecosystems', but if they are in the
# same realm, same country etc., then you only need to write the realm and
# country once. 
indicatorName: 
  - INDICATOR_NAME # add more by adding another line starting '-'
folderName: test # name of the folder under 'indicators/'. 
# If it's a single indicator being reported, the folder name should be the same as the indicatorID. 
# If there are multiple ID's then the folder name could look something like XX_YYY_ZZZ-ÅÅÅ.
country: country
continent: continent
ECT: write ECT here # e.g. A2 - Chemical State characteristics
Realm: 
  - write realm here # e.g. Freshwater (F)
Biome: 
  - write biome here # e.g. F1 Rivers and streams biome
Ecosystem: 
  - write ecosystem here # e.g. F1.3 Freeze-thaw streams
yearAdded: 2025 # the year when the indicator was first submitted to ecRxiv
yearLastUpdate: 2025
status: incomplete # options are complete, incomplete, or deprecated
Version: "000.001" # Beta-versions are numbers incrementally with values below 0. Operational versions can be given the version numbers above 0. Use this terms similar as for software versioning,
VersionComment: Comment here # Describe briefly how this version differs from earlier versions 
url: https://github.com/NINAnor/ecRxiv/tree/main/indicators/XX_YYYY_ZZZ
# Leave the url as is, but replace XX_YYYY_ZZ with the name of the root folder for the current indicator(s). It should be the same as the indicatorID, but if there are more indicator IDs presented in the same folder, the folder name might be different, e.g. XX_YYYY_AAA-BBB 
Normalised: # Yes or no depending on whether the metric has been normliased or not.

<!--# This is a template for how to document the indicator analyses. Make sure also to not change the order, or modify, the headers, unless you really need to. This is because it easier to read if all the indicators are presented using the same layout. If there is one header where you don't have anything to write, just leave the header as is, and don't write anything below it. If you are providing code, be careful to annotate and comment on every step in the analysis. Before starting it is recommended to fill in as much as you can in the metadata file. This file will populate the initial table in your output.-->

<!--# Document you work below.  -->

## 1. Summary

<!--# 
With a maximum of 300 words, describe the indicator in general terms as you would to a non-expert. Think of this as a kind of common language summary. Follow the four numbers sub-headers below. under point 2, it is possible under  include a bullet point list of the specific steps in the workflow. 
 -->

1. **Background and rationale**:
<!-- What does the metric represent? Why is this relevant for describing ecosystem condition in this ecosystem?
What are the main anthropogenic impact factors? -->
2. **Methods**:
<!-- What kind of data is used? How is the data customized (modified, estimated, integrated) to fit its purpose as an indicator? -->
3. **Interpretation**:
<!-- Add a very short description of how the indicator values should be interpreted. Here's an example for a bumblebee indicator: An indicator value of 1 signifies an intact bumblebee community. Values decreasing toward zero reflect negative ecological change, specifically the decline of species expected to be present. This metric does not account for potentially positive changes, such as increases in species' abundance or the arrival of new species. Tip: Add text on the line directly following the subheader, and don't introduce blank lines. This way the whole paragraph renders as a block quote. -->
An indicator value of 1 signifies ...
Values decreasing toward zero reflect...

4. **Results and development needs**:
<!-- Briefly, what does the indicator say about the ecosystem condition. What is the current status of  the metric (can it be used or is it still in development), and what immediate tasks remain to improve the indicator or to make the indicator operational -->



## 2. About the underlying data

<!--# Give a general introduction the datasets you have used, and provide more specific details in the sub-chapters.  -->

### 2.1 Spatial and temporal resolution and extent

<!--# Describe the temporal and spatial resolution and extent of the data used -->

### 2.2 Sampling design

<!-- How was the data sampled? Describe potential sampling biases -->

### 2.3 Original units

<!--# What are the original units for the most relevant  variables in the data-->


### 2.3 Instructions for citing, using and accessing data

<!--# Is the data openly available? If not, how can one access it? What are the key references to the datasets?   -->

### 2.4 Additional comments about the dataset

<!--# Optional. Text here -->

## 3. Indicator properties

### 3.1 Ecosystem Condition Typology Class (ECT)

<!--# Describe the rationale for assigning the indicator to the ECT class. See https://oneecosystem.pensoft.net/article/58218/
This doesnt need to be very long. Maybe just a single sentence. -->

### 3.1.1 Other condition typologies

<!--# Optional: Add text about other standards or typologies, such as alternative national condition typologies, and how the indicator relates to these -->


### 3.2 Ecosystem condition characteristic

<!--# 

Describe the ecosystem condition characteristic represented in the indicator. See 10.3897/oneeco.6.e58218 for information on what these characteristics might be.
For example, and indicator called 'Trenching in mires' could be made to represent an ecosystem characteristic 'Intact hydrology'. The term 'characteristic' is used similar to the term 'criteria' in Multiple Criteria Decision Making.  

-->

### 3.3 Collinearities with other indicators

<!--# Describe known collinearities with other metrics (indicators or variables) that could become problematic if they were also included in the same Ecosystem Condition Assessment as the indicator described here. -->


### 3.4 Impact factors

<!--# Describe the main natural and anthropogenic factors that affecst the metric -->

### 3.5 Spatial aggregation

<!-- Describe in word the same aggregation pathway presented in the top yaml (the metadata). If you have scaled against the reference value, it is especially important to know if you did any avergaing or summations etc. beforehand. An example text for a rather simple case could be: "The variable is scaled at the initial polygon level and the point estimate is a area-weighted arithmetic mean of all polygins. There is no transformation, and truncation is not needed as the indicator becomes naturally bound between 0 and 1".  -->

## 4. Reference condition and levels

### 4.1 Reference condition

<!--# Define the reference condition (or refer to where it is defined). Note the distinction between reference condition and reference levels 10.3897/oneeco.5.e58216  -->

### 4.2 Reference levels

<!--# 

If relevant (i.e. if you have normalised a variable), describe the reference levels used to normalise the variable. 

Use the terminology where X~0~ refers to the reference level (the variable value) denoting the worst possible condition; X~100~denotes the optimum or best possible condition; and X~*n*~, where in is between 0 and 100, denotes any other anchoring points linking the variable scale to the indicator scale (e.g. the threshold value between good and bad condition X~60^). 

Why was the current option chosen and how were the reference levels quantified? If the reference values are calculated as part of the analyses further down, please repeat the main information here.

 -->


#### 4.2.1 Spatial resolution and validity

<!--# 

Describe the spatial resolution of the reference levels. E.g. is it defined as a fixed value for all areas, or does it vary. Also, at what spatial scale are the reference levels valid? For example, if the reference levels have a regional resolution (varies between regions), it might mean that it is only valid and correct to use for normalising local variable values that are first aggregated to regional scale. However, sometimes the reference levels are insensitive to this and can be used to scale variables at the local (e.g. plot) scale. 

 -->

## 5. Uncertainties
### 5.1 General uncertainties
<!--# Describe the main reasons why you might not trust 100% the final value to represent the given ecosystem characteristic for the give ecosystem type. What aspects of this condition metric are most sensitive to subjective decitions? Is the spatial sampling sufficient? Does the choice of modeling framework affect the values? Is the metric relevant do describe ecosystem condition for the give ecosystem type?  -->

### 5.2 Reported uncertainties
<!-- Describe the nature of the errors you (hopefully) provide alongside the point estimate for the condition metric. It is especially important to clarify if the errors are inferential (referring to the uncertainty of the point estimate) or descriptive (referreing to the data itself). Here' an example text: "What we report as uncertainties in @tbl-finalTable are inferential and refer to the uncertainty around the point estimates. It does not directly describe variation in the data itself. 
However, the variation in the mean is defined by the spatial variation only, and quartiles are obtained by bootstrapping the set of localities within a region, and calculating the indicator for each of 9999 such samples".   -->



## 6. References

<!--# You can add references manually or use a citation manager and add intext citations as with crossreferencing and hyperlinks. See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html -->

## 7. Import and prepare datasets

<!--# All the data import and preparation should be done in this chapter, before the analysis chapter. As a minimum, add code for importing data, and describe or show the data structure. You may also explain certain variables, what they represent, and their distributions -->

### 7.1 Dataset A

<!--# Import and prepare the first dataset for analysis. Change the header from Dataset A to the name of the actual dataset. -->

### 7.2. Dataset B

<!--# Repeat the process for each dataset -->

## 8. Spatial units

<!--# Describe the spatial units that you rely on in your analyses. Highlight the spatial units (the resolution) that the indicator values should be interpreted at. Potential spatial delineation data (maksing layers etc.) should be introduced under chapert 7. We recommend using the SEEA EA terminology of Basic Spatial Units (BSU), Ecosystem Asses (EA) and Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA). -->

## 9. Analyses

<!--# 

Use this header for documenting the analyses. Put code in separate code chunks, and annotate the code in between using normal text (i.e. between the chunks, and try to avoid too many hashed out comments inside the code chunks). Add subheaders as needed. 

Code folding is activated, meaning the code will be hidden by default in the html (one can click to expand it).

Caching is also activated (from the top YAML), meaning that rendering to html will be quicker the second time you do it. This will create a folder inside you project folder (called INDICATORID_cache). Sometimes caching created problems because some operations are not rerun when they should be rerun. Try deleting the cash folder and try again.

-->

## 10. Results

<!--# 

Repeat the final results here. Typically this is a map or table of indicator values.

This is typically where people will harvest data from, so make sure to include all relevant output here, but don't clutter this section with too much output either.

-->

## 11. Export file

<!--# 

Optional: Display the code (don't execute it) or the workflow for exporting the indicator values to file. Ideally the indicator values are exported as a georeferenced shape or raster file with indicators values, reference values and errors. You can also chose to export the raw (un-normalised or unscaled variable) as a separate product. You should not save large sptaial output data on GitHub. You can use eval=FALSE to avoid code from being executed (example below - delete if not relevant) 

-->

```{r export}
#| eval: false
```

<!-- You can leave this last part as it is, unless you have a good reason to alter it. -->

## Session Info

This information is mainly aimed at developers that need to recreate the R environment that produced the html.
Important note: this information is about the R session that was running when the html was rendered, and if some of the code chunks were not evaluated when the html was rendered, they may have been executed in a different environment.  

```{r sessionInfo}
#| echo: false
