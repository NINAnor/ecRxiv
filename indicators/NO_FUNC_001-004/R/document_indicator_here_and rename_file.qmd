<!--# This is a template for how to document the indicator analyses. Make sure also to not change the order, or modify, the headers, unless you really need to. This is because it easier to read if all the indicators are presented using the same layout. If there is one header where you don't have anything to write, just leave the header as is, and don't write anything below it. If you are providing code, be careful to annotate and comment on every step in the analysis. Before starting it is recommended to fill in as much as you can in the metadata file. This file will populate the initial table in your output.-->

<!--# Document you work below.  -->

## 1. Summary

<!--# 

With a maximum of 300 words, describe the indicator in general terms as you would to a non-expert. Think of this as a kind of commmon language summary. It is a good idea to include a bullet point list of the spesific steps in the workflow. Include a mention of the following aspects:

What does the metric represent?
Why is this relevant for describing ecosystem condition in this ecosystem?
What are the main anthropogenig impact factors?
What kind of data is used? 
Shortly, how is the data customized (modified, estimated, integarted) to fit its purpuse as an indicator?
What is the current status of  the metric (can it be used or is it still in development)?
How should the metric be used and interpretted, and how should it not be used/interpretted?

 -->

## 2. About the underlying data

<!--# Describe the data you have used in more detail, it's origin, biases, availabilit ect.-->

### 2.1 Spatial and temporal resolution and extent

<!--# Describe the temporal and spatial resolution and extent of the data used -->

### 2.2 Original units

<!--# What are the original units for the most relevant  variables in the data-->

### 2.3 Additional comments about the dataset

<!--# Text here -->

## 3. Indicator properties

### 3.1 Ecosystem Condition Typology Class (ECT)

<!--# 

Describe the rationale for assigning the indicator to the ECT class. See https://oneecosystem.pensoft.net/article/58218/
This doesnt need to be very long. Maybe just a single sentence. 

-->

### 3.2 Ecosystem condition characteristic

<!--# 

Describe the ecosystem condition characteristic represented in the indicator. See 10.3897/oneeco.6.e58218 for information on what these characteristics might be.
For example, and indicator called 'Trenching in mires' could be made to represent an ecosystem characteristic 'Intact hydrology'. The term 'characteristic' is used similar to the term 'criteria' in Multiple Criteria Decition Making.  

-->

### 3.3 Other standards

<!--# Optional: Add text about other spesific standards, e.g. national standards, and how the indicator relates to these -->

### 3.4 Collinearities with other indicators

<!--# Describe known collinearities with other metrices (indicators or variables) that could become problematic if they were also included in the same Ecosystem Condition Assessment as the indicator described here. -->


### 3.5 Impact factors

<!--# Describe the main natural and anthropogenic factors that affecst the metric -->


## 4. Reference condition and levels

### 4.1 Reference condition

<!--# Define the reference condition (or refer to where it is defined). Note the destinction between reference condition and reference levels 10.3897/oneeco.5.e58216  -->

### 4.2 Reference levels

<!--# 

If relevant (i.e. if you have normalised a variable), describe the reference levels used to normalise the variable. 

Use the terminology where X~0~ referes to the referece level (the variable value) denoting the worst possible condition; X~100~denotes the optimum or best possible condition; and X~*n*~, where in is between 0 and 100, denotes any other anchoring points linking the variable scale to the indicator scale (e.g. the threshold value between good and bad condition X~60^). 

Why was the current option chosen and how were the reference levels quantified? If the reference values are calculated as part of the analyses further down, please repeat the main information here.

 -->


#### 4.2.1 Spatial resolution and validity

<!--# 

Describe the spatial resolution of the reference levels. E.g. is it defined as a fixed value for all areas, or does it vary. Also, at what spatial scale are the reference levels valid? For example, if the reference levels have a regional resolution (varies between regions), it might mean that it is only valid and correct to use for normalising local variable values that are first aggregated to regional scale. However, sometimes the reference levels are insensitive to this and can be used to scale variables at the local (e.g. plot) scale. 

 -->

## 5. Uncertainties

<!--# Describe the main uncertainties or sources of error in the indicator or the underlying data. -->

## 6. References

<!--# You can add references manually or use a citation manager and add intext citations as with crossreferencing and hyperlinks. See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html -->

## 7. Datasets

<!--# Describe the unique datasets seperately under seperate headers (Dataset A, Dataset B, etc.-->

### 7.1 Dataset A

<!--# Describe the main dataset, typicaly the one containing the variable of (most) interest. Change the header from Dataset A to the name of the actuall dataset. -->

### 7.2. Dataset B

<!--# Describe additional datasets in a similar was as above. Deleteor add ned subheaders as needed. -->

## 8. Spatial units

<!--# 

Describe the spatial units that you rely on in your analyses. Highlight the spatial units (the resolution) that the indicator values should be interpretted at. Potential spatial delineation data should eb introduced under 7.1. Datasets. We recomend using the SEEA EA terminology opf Basic Spatial Units (BSU), Ecosystem Asses (EA) and Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA). 

-->

## 9. Analyses

<!--# 

Use this header for documenting the analyses. Put code in seperate code chunks, and annotate the code in between using normal text (i.e. between the chunks, and try to avoid too many hashed out comments inside the code chunks). Add subheaders as needed. 

Code folding is activated, meaning the code will be hidden by default in the html (one can click to expand it).

Caching is also activated (from the top YAML), meaning that rendering to html will be quicker the second time you do it. This will create a folder inside you project folder (called INDICATORID_cache). Sometimes caching created problems because some operations are not rerun when they should be rerun. Try deleting the cash folder and try again.

-->

## 10. Results

<!--# 

Repeat the final results here. Typically this is a map or table of indicator values.

This is typically where people will harvest data from, so make sure to include all relevant output here, but don't clutter this section with too much output either.

-->

## 11. Export file

<!--# 

Optional: Display the code (don't execute it) or the workflow for exporting the indicator values to file. Ideally the indicator values are exported as a georeferenced shape or raster file with indicators values, reference values and errors. You can also chose to export the raw (un-normalised or unscaled variable) as a seperate product. You should not save large sptaial output data on GitHub. You can use eval=FALSE to avoid code from being executed (example below - delete if not relevant) 

-->

```{r export}
#| eval: false
```
